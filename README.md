# Project Application Development
This project is the first assignment of the second year of the Mathematical Engineering Bachelor of Science.
The application uses (at this stage basic) mathematical models to calculate future animal populations in the Oostvaardersplassen Nature Preserve in the Netherlands. 

The current mathematical models are very basic and not at all accurate to the real life situation, but the code has been made in such a way that implementing more complex models is as easy as adding a new class and line of code.
This was our first time using Git for a project. Therefore, the structure and commit history is not the greatest.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this software a Java Runtime must be installed on your pc. 
This software is cross-platform and can be used on any pc with a JRE installed.

## Installing

Download the [ProjectAP v1.1](Application/ProjectAP-v1.1) folder from the Application folder in this repository and from there the runnable .jar file can be used.
